"""
Conditional Statements - if, elif, else, it is a keyword.
If the first (if) statement cannot be true, then we use an elif statement. And, if the (if statement) is true,
then we avoid the elif statement no matter if elif statements are true or not.
If we use (if statement) then both the statements will execute.
We only check an elif statement when the first(if) statement is false.
